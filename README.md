# FlagSync SDK for Nest.js

At [FlagSync](https://www.flagsync.com), we believe the power of feature flags and A/B testing should be accessible to everyone, regardless of business size or budget.

That's why we developed an affordable, user-friendly platform that delivers the core functionality needed by indie hackers and growing businesses, without unnecessary complexity. [Get started](https://docs.flagsync.com/getting-started/set-up-flagsync) using FlagSync today!

## Coming Soon!

## Getting Started

Refer to the [SDK documentation](https://docs.flagsync.com/sdks/nest) for more information on how to use this library.

## Node

This SDK wraps the [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/flagsync/javascript-client) for smoother integration with Nest.js applications. However, if you're building a non-Nest.js application for Node.js, you should use our isomorphic [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/flagsync/javascript-client) instead.

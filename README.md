## Getting Started

Refer to the [SDK documentation](https://docs.flagsync.com/sdks/nest.js) for more information on how to use this library.

## Node

This SDK wraps the [Node SDK](https://github.com/flagsync/node-client) for smoother integration with [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) applications. However, if you're building a non-Nest.js application for Node.js, you should use our [Node SDK](https://github.com/flagsync/node-client) instead.
